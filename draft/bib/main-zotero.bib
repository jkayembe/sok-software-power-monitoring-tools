  abstract = {Energy accounting is crucial in data centers for optimizing power provisioning, capping, and tuning. This paper introduces the Kepler framework, which estimates power consumption at the process, container, and Kubernetes pod levels. Kepler offers a set of power models applicable to various architectures and metrics. In this study, we propose a generic power model that utilizes hardware counters (HC) and realtime system power metrics (e.g., running average power limit (RAPL)) as independent variables in a regression model. Unlike previous approaches that rely on aggregate power consumption, our methodology measures individual process power consumption to train the power model. We provide step-by-step instructions to measure process power consumption in a controlled environment, considering the activation constant and load-dependent dynamic power consumption in different executions. By following the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, our approach ensures the fair distribution of constant power among the user's processes. The results demonstrate significantly improved accuracy with a mean squared error (MSE) as low as 0.010 for the proposed method, compared with an MSE of 0.16 for a simple ratio approach and 0.92 when training the model using aggregated workload power.},

  abstract = {Recently, container-based solutions have become de facto compute units of modern cloud-native applications. However, the exponential growth in data traffic and the power consumption of these technologies to handle high data traffic alarm the strong need for energy evaluation approaches in containerized clouds. Furthermore, the proliferation of highly distributed edge clouds raises additional concerns regarding the power consumption of future cloud architectures. This article presents a detailed overview of methods and techniques for monitoring power consumption within popular cloud platforms. The study offers an in-depth evaluation of these approaches, demonstrating variations in measured power consumption based on the chosen technique. A well-known container orchestration platform named Kubernetes (K8s) has been applied in our extensive measurements. This work argues that energy-efficient container clouds will play a vital role in building a more sustainable and eco-friendly digital infrastructure by optimizing power consumption and reducing carbon footprint, paving the way for a greener future. The paper also discusses open challenges and future research directions on energy sustainability, leading to the conclusion, offering lessons learned and prospects on potential solutions to foster sustainable practices within the container ecosystem.},

  abstract = {The environmental impact of software is gaining increasing attention as the demand for computational resources continues to rise. In order to optimize software resource consumption and reduce carbon emissions, measuring and evaluating software is a first essential step. In this paper we discuss what metrics are important for fact base decision making. We introduce the Green Metrics Tool (GMT), a novel framework for accurately measuring the resource consumption of software. The tool provides a containerized, controlled, and reproducible life cycle-based approach, assessing the resource use of software during key phases. Finally, we discuss GMT features like visualization, comparability and rule- and LLM-based optimisations highlighting its potential to guide developers and researchers in reducing the environmental impact of their software.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we explore the intersection of privacy, security, and environmental sustainability in cloud-based office solutions, focusing on quantifying user- and network-side energy use and associated carbon emissions. We hypothesise that privacy-focused services are typically more energy-efficient than those funded through data collection and advertising. To evaluate this, we propose a framework that systematically measures environmental costs based on energy usage and network data traffic during well-defined, automated usage scenarios. To test our hypothesis, we first analyse how underlying architectures and business models, such as monetisation through personalised advertising, contribute to the environmental footprint of these services. We then explore existing methodologies and tools for software environmental impact assessment. We apply our framework to three mainstream email services selected to reflect different privacy policies, from ad-supported tracking-intensive models to privacy-focused designs: Microsoft Outlook, Google Mail (Gmail), and Proton Mail. We extend this comparison to a self-hosted email solution, evaluated with and without end-to-end encryption. We show that the self-hosted solution, even with 14\% of device energy and 15\% of emissions overheads from PGP encryption, remains the most energy-efficient, saving up to 33\% of emissions per session compared to Gmail. Among commercial providers, Proton Mail is the most efficient, saving up to 0.1 gCO2 e per session compared to Outlook, whose emissions can be further reduced by 2\% through ad-blocking.},

  abstract = {Green IT has emerged as a discipline concerned with the optimization of software solutions with regards to their energy consumption. In this domain, most of the state-of-the-art solutions concentrate on coarse-grained approaches to monitor the energy consumption of a device or a process. In this paper, we report on a fine-grained runtime energy monitoring framework we developed to help developers to diagnose energy hotspots with a better accuracy. Concretely, our approach adopts a two-layer architecture including OS-level and process-level energy monitoring. OS-level energy monitoring estimates the energy consumption of processes according to different hardware devices (CPU, network card). Process-level energy monitoring focuses on Java-based applications and builds on OS-level energy monitoring to provide an estimation of energy consumption at the granularity of classes and methods. We argue that this per-method analysis of energy consumption provides better insights to the application in order to identify potential energy hotspots. In particular, our preliminary validation demonstrates that we can monitor energy hotspots of Jetty web servers and monitor their variations under stress scenarios.},
